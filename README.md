An animation of moving fish in a fish tank was created in PowerPoint. A script was developed using generative AI coding combined with manual fine-tuning to leverage computer vision processes on a video of a fish tank, enabling the tracking of fish movements. The process begins with calibrating the video feed using a reference object of known size to establish a pixel-to-centimeter ratio. Background subtraction and object detection techniques are then applied to track the fishâ€™s movement across frames, calculating key metrics such as total distance traveled, depth, and speed. Results include a graph of instantaneous speed and preferred depth, as well as a CSV file summarizing the metrics. A video of the fish tracking process and the script itself has been uploaded to GitHub. Future steps include testing the script with a live camera feed and fish-like objects and integrating machine learning techniques to quantify more complex behaviors.
